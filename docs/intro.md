# About Me

Sometimes I feel like I have two brains.

One is all about the technical stuff and the space between things. The other craves an outlet to create things I haven't seen before. Keeping myself accountable to maintaining a balancing of both aspects is what this blog is about.

Its purpose is to help me say I did a thing, and why it went the way it did. To write about a problem I solved, a rabbit hole I found, or new approach I am testing out. I often think of it like I'm a pilot lost in the fog. When a mountain emerges out of nowhere, will I pull up in time? Did I? Probably stuff like that.

Last website I created was a Geocities page I put together in middle school back in the mid 90s. I’m bringing that DIY creative spirit forward here. Just me and my blissful ignorance of web design best practices.

To anybody else who wishes I’d post more on social media: This blog is now that thing, too. So come here sometimes, and you’ll know the stuff that I’ve been up to. Might not be fascinating, but it’s all right here! Don’t even need to ask first.
